                    <p>The raffles will be one of the main tools of our platform and will serve to obtain benefits from the user and the entry of new investors interested in obtaining DEXC. These will be beneficial for the whole community since each draw will assign the destination of the DEXC collected, such as burning sections, redistribution or for other future functions of the platform. This section will serve solely and exclusively to benefit the holder of the token, since, in one way or another, they will obtain a direct or indirect benefit.</p>
